As the title suggests, Ajax Profile Comments makes it possible for users to leave comments on their profiles. It uses a nice sliding interface that doesn't require page loads for things like posting new comments, modifying, or deleting.

This mod uses a few icons from the [url=http://led24.de/iconset/]LED icon[/url] set.

I release this mod and all the code in it to anyone who wants to use it in hopes that it may be found useful. Attribution is not necessary, nor do you need to provide a link back to my website. You are free to use this mod for any purpose, including commercial works, redistribution and derivative works. The only contingency is that the link back to the [url=http://led24.de/iconset/]LED icon set[/url] must remain, as this mod uses two icons from that set. Namely comment_delete.png and comment_edit.png. Both images are found in the root directory of the package. All other images are made by myself and can be used freely. Lastly, this mod comes with no guarantees that it will work well on all servers and configurations, and I will not be held responsible for damages, expenses or problems that may have been caused by the mod's use.
