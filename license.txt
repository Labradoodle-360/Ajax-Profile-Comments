I release this mod and all the code in it to anyone who wants to use it in hopes that it may be found useful.  Attribution is not necessary,
nor do you need to provide a link back to my website.  You are free to use this mod for any purpose, including commercial works,
redistribution and derivative works.  The only contingency is that the link back to the LED icon set (http://led24.de/iconset/) must remain, as this mod uses two icons
from that set. Namely comment_delete.png and comment_edit.png. Both images are found in the root directory of the package. All other
images are made by myself and can be used freely. Lastly, this mod comes with no guarantees that it will work well on all servers and
 configurations, and I will not be held responsible for damages, expenses or problems that may have been caused by the mod's use.
